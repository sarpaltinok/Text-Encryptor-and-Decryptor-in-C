# Text Encryptor and Decryptor in C

This project is a simple text encryption and decryption program implemented in C. It uses a substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter from a key that consists of 26 unique alphabetic characters.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt messages using a user-provided key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt encrypted messages using the same key.
- **Key Validation**: Ensures that the key is a valid set of 26 unique alphabetic characters.
